Definition of Composite Pattern from notes: Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in
similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as
well as whole hierarchy. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree
structure of group of objects.

Example of Composite Pattern:

Good basic overview of the Composite Pattern. The implementation steps from this site have been a huge help in the
design of our own design of the pattern. The breakdown of the coding example is a definite help as well.

Great Youtube video about the structure and summary of the composite pattern. The pictures of the structure, along with
the live coding demonstration were helpful too. He went really in-depth to the pattern and explained the process
clearly, and concisely. I didn't know that the composite can be broken down further into 'Leafs' which is something new
I learned from watching this guide.
